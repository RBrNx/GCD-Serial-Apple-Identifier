For this project we (me and my partner) were tasked with developing an automatic apple indetifciation system which used image feature analysis. This program works by performing Edge Detection with a Sobel Filter. This Edge Detection is then ran through several different thresholds until most of the noise has been reduced or removed. After this a mask of the apple is then generated from the finished Edge Detection and a Colour Histogram is then performed for only the pixels of the apple inside the mask (i.e it ignores the background). This Colour Histogram is then compared to an averaged histogram for each type of apple, the types of apple that are identified as similar are then printed to the console.
